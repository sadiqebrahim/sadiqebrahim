        <p>The C ++ programming language was developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup. He found 'C' lacking for
          simulations and decided to extend the language by adding features from his favourite language, Simula 67. Simula 67 was one of the earliest
          object-oriented languages. Bjame Stroustrup called it "C with Classes" originally. The name C++ (pronounced C plus plus) was coined by Rick
          Mascitti where"++" is the C increment operator. Ever since its birth, C++ evolved to cope with problems encountered by users, and through
          discussions at AT&T. However, the maturation of the C++ language was attested to by two events :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the formation of an ANSI (American National Standard Institute) C++ committee</li>
          <li>the publication of The Annotated C ++ Reference Manual by Ellis and Stroustrup.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The latest C ++ standards document was issued by ANSI/ISO in year 2011 namely C++11 or formally C++Ox.</p>

        <p>The major reason behind the success and popularity of  C++ is that it supports the object oriented technology, the latest in the software
          development and the most near to the real world.</p>

        <p>We will begin with a brief discussion of various programming paradigms that C++ supports i.e., procedural programming style, object
          based programming style and object oriented programming style. This is followed by detailed discussion of object oriented programming and
          its implementation. All this shall help you appreciate OOP style and its advantages over other programming methodologies.</p>

       </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Progrmming_Paradigms">
         <header>Progrmming Paradigms</header>

         <p>A programming paradigm defines the methodology of designing and implementing programs using the key features and other building blocks
           (such as key- words, function preprocessor directions etc .) of a programming language. A programming paradigm gives you an idea how problems
           are generally analysed and solved in a particular programming language.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Object Based Programming</li>
        <p>Object based Programming is a newer paradigm that implements some features of object oriented programming but not all. In object based programming,
          data and its associated meaningful functions are enclosed in one single entity a class. Classes enforce information hiding and abstraction thereby
          separating the implementation details (how the process is actually taking place) and the uses interface (i .e ., how the uses views and uses it).
          [For instance, you can consider a calculator, its interface would include a small display screen and a few buttons that is available to user and
          implementation details i. e., how actual calculations are ta king place are hidden from user.]</p>

        <p>In other words, users of a class are allowed to access its interface but they cannot access its implementation details.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Object based programming localizes the implementation details</li>
          <p>In object bas ed programming, whenever there is any change in the definition of type, user's interface remains unaffected generally. For example,
             consider the same student structure which will be implemented as class in object based programming as shown below :</p>
             <code>class Student
             { int rollno;
                 char name[25] ;
                 int clas ;
                 float marks ;

                 public :
                  void readstudent( ) ;
                   void dispstudent( ) ;
               } ;</code>

          <p>For now, all you need to know is that a class is a structure and it can even hold functions in it. And only the declarations under public: make
            user interface. Now if you need to include one more field grade in Student then the class would became as:</p>
            <code>class Student
              { int rollno;
              char name[25] ";
              int clas;
              float marks ;
              char grade;
            </code>

            <code>
              public :
              void readstudent( ) ;
              void disstudent( ) ;
            } ;
            </code>

          <p>Now the users would not know that a newfield has been added ; they continue to get the same interface.</p>
          <p>But don't you think there would be some changes in the code of some functions? yes, you are right, some changes would definitely be there 1n some
             code (e .g., in d1spstudent) by the programmer, but the user cannot acccss the data of the class student directly which was possible in procedural
             programming. This is becuse the change is localized to the definition of the chnnged function.</p>

          <li>Object based programming is subset of Object Oriented programming</li>
          <p>The object based programming can be thought of as subset of object oriented progrnmming as it also implements some of the features implemented
            by object oriented programming e.g., information hiding, abstraction, classes, function overloading etc. but it does not implement inheritance and
            thereby polymorphism as polymorphism requires inheritance for its implementation. So, neither inheritance nor polymorphism is implemented by object
           based languages.</p>

          <li>Advantages and Limitations of Object based programming</li>
          <p>Being a subset of object oriented programming, the object based programmings offers some similar advantages as OO programing e.g.,</p>
          <ol>
            <li> it overcomes most shortcomings of procedural programming,</li>
            <li> it localizes changes and hides implementation details from user,</li>
            <li> it supports user-defined types,</li>
            <li> implements information hiding and abstraction etc.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>However, object based programming suffers from one major limitation and that is its inability to represent real world relationships that exist among
            object. For example, both car and truck are vehicles. This cannot be represented in object based programming as it does not support inheritance.</p>
        </ol>
         <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
         <p>The object oriented programming paradigm is superset of object based programming. It offers all the features of object based programming and overcomes
           its limitations by implementing inheritance so that real-world relations among objects can be represented programmahcally.</p>
         </ul>
       </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Concepts_of_OOP">
         <header>Basic Concepts Of OOP</header>
         <p>The object oriented programming has been developed with a view to overcome the drawbacks of conventional programming approaches. The OOP approach is based
            on certain concepts that help it attain its goal of overcoming the drawbacks or shortcomings of conventional programming approaches. These general concepts
            of OOP are given below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data Abstraction</li>
              <li>Data Encapsulation</li>
              <li>Modularity</li>
              <li>Inheritance</li>
              <li>Polymorphism</li>
            </ul>

          <ol>
            <li>Data Abstraction</li>
            <p>Abstraction is the concept of simplifying a real world concept into its essential elements.</p>
            <p>To understand abstraction, let us take an example. You are driving a car. you only know the essential features to drive a car e.g., gear handhling,
              steering handling, use of clutch, accelerator, brakes etc. etc. But while driving do you get into internal details of car like wiring, motor working
            etc.? You just change the gears or apply the brakes etc. What is happening inside is hidden from you. This is abstraction where you only know the
            essential things to drive a car without including the background details or explanations.  Take another example of switch board. You only press certain
            switches according to your requirement. What is happening inside, how it is happening etc. you needn't know. Again this is abstraction, you know only
            the essential things to operate on switch board without knowing the background details of switch board.</p>

            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <p>Encapsulation is the most fundamental concept of OOP. It is the way of combining both data and the functions that operate on that data under a
              single unit.</p>
            <p>The only way to access the data is provided by the functions (that are combined along with the data). These functions are called member functions
              in C ++. The data cannot be accessed directly. If you want to read a data item in an object (an instance of the class) you call a member function
              in the object. lt will read the item and return the value to you. You can't access the data directly . The data is hidden, so it is safe from
              accidental alteration. Data and its functions are said to be encapsulated into a single entity.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider an analogy to encapsulation. In a big company, there are so many departments, Sales, Accounts, Payroll, Purchase, Production
               etc. Each department has its own personnel that maintain its data. Suppose an employee in the production dept. wants to know how much raw material
                has been purchased for the next month. The production dept employee would not be allowed to himself go through the purchase dept. data files.
                Rather he'll have to issue a memo to the 'purchase' requesting for the required information. Then some employee of the 'purchase' dept. will go
                through the purchase data files and send the reply with the asked information. This practice ensures that the data is accessed accurately and that
                it is not corrupted by inept outsiders. Therefore, we can say here 'Department data and department employees are encapsulated into a single entity,
                the department'. In the same way, objects provide an approach to program organization while helping to maintain the integrity of the program data.
                Since the classes use the concept of data abstraction, they are known as Abstract Data Types (ADT). 'Data types' because these can be used to create
                objects of its own type.</p>
            <p>Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses upon the observable behaviour of an object, whereas encapsulation
              focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behaviour. Encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the
              process of hiding all the secrets of an object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics, the structure of an object is hidden, as
              well as the implementation of its methods. Only the essential characteristics of object are visible. In the above example of departments, only the
              essential information of departments are visible viz . dept-name, dept-head, no-of-employees etc. The secret information which is not essential is
              hidden viz. dept-profit/loss, stock etc. This information is made avail able only if the request is made through proper channel e.g ., issuing a memo
              etc.</p>

            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <p>Polymorphism is key to the power of object oriented programming. It is so important that languages that don't support polymorphism cannot advertise
               themselves as OO languages. Languages that support classes but not polymorphism are called ob1ect-based language. Ada is such a language.</p>
            <p>Polymorphism is the concept that supports the capability of an object of a class to behave differently in response to a message or action. For
              instance, 'Human' is a subclass of 'Mammal'. Similarly dog, cat, are also subclasses of 'Mammal'. Mammals can see throug day-light. So if a message,
              'see through daylight' is passed to all mammals, they all will behave alike. Now if a message 'see through darkness is passed to a mammals, then
              humans and dogs will not be able to view at night whereas cats will be able to view during night also. Here cats (mammals) can behave differently
              than other mammals in response to a message or action. This 1s polymorphism. Take another example. If you give 5 + 7, it results into 12, the sum of 5
              and 7. And if you give 'A' + 'BC', it results into 'ABC' , the concatenated strings . The same operation symbol '+' is able to distinguish between the
              two operations (summation and concatenation) depending upon the data type it is working on. Here we can define polymorphism in context of OO programming.

          <header>Implementing OOP Concepts</header>
           <ol>
             <li>Implementing Objects</li>
             <p>Our aim is to implement a real world object in the form of a software object. Real World objects have physical characteristics (state) and behaviour
               e.g., a motorbike has:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Characteristics - current gear, two wheels, number of gears, .. ....</li>
                 <li>Behaviour - braking, accelerating, charging years etc.</li>
                 <li>The software objects also have state and behaviour.</li>
                 <li>Their state is maintained through variables or data items.</li>
                 <li>Their behaviour is implemented through functions generally called methods.</li>
               </ul>
              <p>In other words, we can define an object, in software terms, as a software bundle of variables and related methods.</p>
              <p>While implementing an abstraction of a real world entity in software form, all its physical characteristics are depicted through data items and all
                its functionality i.e., behaviour is implemented through functions which are called methods</p>
              <li>Implementing Data Hiding, Data Abstraction and Encapsulation</li>
              <p>Encapsulation is wrapping up of characteristics and behaviour into one unit. While implement1ng encapsulation, following things are taken care of
                :</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Anything that an object does not know or cannot do is excluded from the object.</li>
                  <li>Encapsulnt1on is used to hide unimportant implementation details from other objects.</li>
                  <li>Packaging an object's variables within the protective custody of its methods is called encapsulation and this task is accomplished through
                    Classes i.e., the data and associated functions are wrapped up in one unit called class.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A class binds together data and its associated functions under one unit thereby enforcing encapsulation as encapsulation means wrapping up
                  data and associated functions together into a single unit.</p>
                <p>A class groups its members into three sections : private, protected, and public. The private and protected members remain hidden from outside
                  world. Thus through private and protected members, a class enforces data-hiding.</p>
                <p>The outside world is given only the essential and necessary information through public members, rest of the things remain hidden , which is
                  nothing but abstraction. As abstraction means representation of essential features without including the background details or explanation.</p>
                <p>A class is defined as:</p>
                <code>class 'class name' { private :
                                    // hidden data members/methods here
                                    protected :
                                    // unimportant implementation details here
                                    public:
                                    // exposed important details here.
                } ;</code>
                <p>Through encapsulation, an interface is made available to world through which users can use the class. For example,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>When you want to change gears on your motor bike you don't need to know how the gear mechanism works, you just need to know which lever
                     to move.</li>
                  <li>with software objects, you don't need to know how a method is implemented; you just need to know which method to invoke and its interface.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And benefits that come bundled with encapsulation are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Modularity</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>Source code can be writteen and maintained independently.</li>
                     <li>An obiect can be passed easily around.</li>
                   </ul>
                  <li>Information hiding</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>An object has a public interfacef or other objects to communicate with.</li>
                      <li>An object can maaintain private information and methods that can be changed without affecting other objects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <li>Implementing Inheritance</li>
                <p>Inheritance is implemented in C++ by specifying the name of the (base) class from which the class being defined (the derived class) has
                  to inherit from.</p>\
                <p>It is done somewhat like :</p>
                <code>class< derived class name> : < base class name>
                  {
                    ~ derived class own features.
                  }</code>
                <p>In C++ an Abstract Class is the one, which defines an interface, but does not necessarily provide implementations for all its member functions.
                  An abstract class is meant to be used as the base class from which other classes are derived. The derived class is expected to provide
                  implementations for the member functions that are not implemented in the base class. A derived class that implements all the missing functionality
                  is called a Concrete Class. A concrete class derives from its abstract class.</p>
                <p>To understand this, consider the following example.</p>
                <p>A shape is an abstract class. It suggests a state e.g. , shapes have a colour, or siz etc. It defines on interface also - shapes have surface
                  area , volume, perimeter etc. But it does not specify how to implement this interface . If I ask, how would you calculate area of a shape? You'll
                  ask-which shape? See, it itself explains it. There is no direct instance of shape. From shape class, other classes like circle class, rectangle
                  class, triangle class inherit. These classes are concrete classes as they provide proper functionality for its member functions. A shape can always
                  be either a circle or a triangle and so on. It can't just only be a shape- for shape is abstract, a triangle or a circle is concrete.</p>
                <li>Implementation Polymorphism</li>
                 <p>Polynomial is the attribute that allows one interface to be used with different situation.</p>
                 <p>C++ implements polymorphis m through virtual functions, overloaded functions and overloaded operators. A virtual function is used to specify
                   the interface 1s abstract class, but its implementation details are made available by the concrete class(es) . The term overloading means a
                 name having two or more distinct meanings. Thus an overloaded function refers to a function having (one name and) more than one distinct meanings.
               Similarly, when two or more distinst meanings are defined for an operator, it is said to be overloaded operator.</p>

         <header>Advantages Of OOP</header>
         <ol>
           <li>Re-use of code</li>
           <p>Linking of code to objects and explicit specification of relations between objects allows relatcd objects to share code. Encapsulation allows class
             definitions to be re-used in oher  applications. The availability of a consistent interface to objects lessens code duplication and thereby improves
             code re-usability.</p>
            <li>Ease of comprehension</li>
            <p>THe classes can be set up to closely represent the generic application concepts and processes. OOP codes are more near to real-world models than
              other programming methodologies' codes.</p>
            <li>Ease of fabrication and maintenance</li>
            <p>The concepts such as encapsulation, data abstraction allow for verv clean designs When an object is going into disallowed states, which are not
              permitted,  only its methods need be investigated e.g. if student is getting more than maximum marks, only the functions are to be retested. This
              narrows down search for problems.</p>
            <li>Easy redesign and extension</li>
            <p>The same concepts facilitate easy redesign and extension.</p>
